# Adopting Serverless Architecture

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2024-10-05
- **Work Item:** 0001-Serverless_Adoption

## BLUF

To rapidly build a scalable web application while minimizing infrastructure management overhead, the startup chose **serverless architecture using Azure Functions** over traditional server-based or containerized microservices. Given limited resources and unpredictable traffic, this decision was driven by the need for **quick deployment, automatic scaling, and reduced operational costs**. While serverless enables **faster time-to-market and eliminates infrastructure management**, it introduces **a learning curve and vendor lock-in concerns**. Implementation includes **integrating Azure services, monitoring performance, and training the team**, with periodic reviews ensuring long-term viability.

> 1. **Context and Problem:** Summarize the core challenge or opportunity that prompted the decision.
> 2. **Decision Drivers:** Highlight the main factors influencing the decision (e.g., need for rapid development, cost reduction, scalability, limited resources).
> 3. **Considered Options:** Briefly mention the evaluated alternatives and the rationale behind their pros and cons.
> 4. **Decision Outcome:** Clearly state the chosen option and outline its benefits and any noted drawbacks, such as potential learning curves or vendor lock-in concerns.

## Context and Problem

As a tech startup, we must quickly build a scalable web application to meet growing user demand. Traditional infrastructure solutions would require significant time and resources, which we cannot afford.

## Decision Drivers

- There is a need for rapid development and deployment to stay competitive.
- Limited resources for managing infrastructure
- Unpredictable traffic patterns requiring automatic scaling
- Minimizing operational overhead to focus on core development

## Considered Options

- Serverless Architecture (Azure Functions)
- Traditional Server-Based Architecture
- Containerized Microservices

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Serverless Architecture (Azure Functions)," because it allowed the team to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management, provided automatic scaling, and minimized operational overhead.

#### Consequences

- **Good, because:** Faster time-to-market, reduced operational costs, and improved scalability.
- **Bad, because:** Initial learning curve and dependency on third-party services, leading to some vendor lock-in concerns.

#### Implementation

- Set up Azure Functions for backend processing.
- Integrate with other Azure services (API Management, Cosmos DB, etc.) as needed.
- Monitor performance and make adjustments as required.
- Train the team on serverless best practices and Azure tools.

#### Confirmation

- Regular performance reviews and scaling checks
- Continuous monitoring of costs and operational overhead
- Feedback loops from the development team to ensure smooth operations

#### Stakeholders

- Development Team
- Operations Team
- Product Management
- Customers

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Serverless Architecture (Azure Functions)

- **Good, because:** Faster development, reduced costs, automatic scaling.
- **Bad, because:** Learning curve, dependency on Azure, potential vendor lock-in.

### Traditional Server-Based Architecture

- **Good, because:** Familiar to the team, more control over infrastructure.
- **Bad, because:** Higher operational overhead, slower to scale, increased time-to-market.

### Containerized Microservices

- **Good, because:** Flexibility, isolation of services, easier scaling than traditional servers.
- **Bad, because:** More complex setup and management, still requires infrastructure oversight.
